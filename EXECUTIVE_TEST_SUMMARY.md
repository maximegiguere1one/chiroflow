## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE (Blocks Launch)

### **BUG-001: Appointment Date/Time Broken**

**What's Wrong:**

```

**Impact:**
- Appointments may not save correctly
- Dates may not display
- Risk of data corruption

**Who's Affected:**
- 10+ component files
- Core appointment scheduling feature

**How to Fix:**
- Refactor code to use scheduled_at instead
- Time required: 6-8 hours
- Risk: LOW (isolated issue)

**Decision Required:**
- [ ] Fix before launch (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Launch with workaround (NOT RECOMMENDED)
