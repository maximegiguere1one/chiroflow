## 🚨 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Current Blockers
1. Vitest not in package.json dependencies (easy fix)
2. Large components blocking refactoring efforts
3. No monitoring in production (visibility gap)

### Risks
1. **Technical Debt:** Large files will slow future development
2. **Testing Gap:** No tests means high regression risk
3. **Performance:** Bundle size may impact user experience
4. **Monitoring:** Can't measure what we don't track

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Prettier configuration
- ✅ Design system tokens
- ✅ Core components (Button, Input, Toast)
- ✅ Logger infrastructure
- ✅ Bundle code splitting
- ✅ Path aliases
