**Key deliverable:** Clean, maintainable architecture

### Week 3: Test Coverage (Nov 11-15)
**What you'll write:**
- 10+ hook tests
- 50+ component tests
- 4 integration test suites
- Test data factories

**Key deliverable:** 40% test coverage

### Week 4: State Management (Nov 18-22)
**What you'll implement:**
- Zustand stores
- Real-time sync
- Optimistic updates
- Cache system

**Key deliverable:** Modern state management

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### Clean Architecture
Separates business logic from UI and infrastructure:
```
Domain (entities, rules)
  ↓
Application (use-cases)
  ↓
Infrastructure (API, DB)
  ↓
Presentation (UI)
```

### Test-Driven Development
Write tests first, then code:
```
1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat
```

### Zustand State Management
Simple, fast state management:
```typescript
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  data: [],
  add: (item) => set(state => ({
    data: [...state.data, item]
  }))
}));
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Testing
npm test                    # Watch mode
npm run test:run           # Run once
npm run test:ui            # UI mode
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report

# Building
npm run build              # Production build
npm run dev                # Development server

# Code Quality
