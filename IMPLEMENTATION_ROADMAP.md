- Contingency: Feature flags for gradual rollout

**2. Performance Optimization**
- Risk: Over-optimization affecting maintainability
- Mitigation: Measure first, optimize bottlenecks
- Contingency: Keep optimization modular

**3. Testing Coverage**
- Risk: Tests slowing down development
- Mitigation: Focus on critical paths first
- Contingency: Parallel test writing

**4. Timeline Slippage**
- Risk: 16-week timeline is aggressive
- Mitigation: Weekly reviews and adjustments
- Contingency: Phase prioritization

### Medium Priority Risks

**5. Third-party Dependencies**
- Risk: Breaking changes in libraries
- Mitigation: Lock versions, test updates
- Contingency: Version rollback plan

**6. Browser Compatibility**
- Risk: Features not working on all browsers
- Mitigation: Progressive enhancement
