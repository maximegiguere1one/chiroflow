# Email System Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified

Your emails were being sent to `delivered@resend.dev` (Resend's test inbox) instead of the intended recipient `maxime@giguere-influence.com`.

**Root Cause:** The RESEND_DOMAIN is either:
- Not configured in Supabase secrets, OR
- Set to a default value like "example.com", OR
- **Most likely:** Configured but NOT VERIFIED in your Resend dashboard

When a domain is not verified in Resend, all emails are automatically routed to `delivered@resend.dev` for safety.

Console will show:
```
üîç Domain janiechiro.com status: not_started
‚ö†Ô∏è Le domaine janiechiro.com n'est PAS v√©rifi√© dans Resend.
   L'email sera envoy√© √† delivered@resend.dev au lieu de maxime@giguere-influence.com

## How to Fix This Issue

### Step 1: Verify Your Supabase Configuration

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Edge Functions** > **Secrets**
3. Verify these secrets exist:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxx
   RESEND_DOMAIN=janiechiro.com
   APP_DOMAIN=your-app.com
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Your Domain in Resend (CRITICAL)

**This is most likely your issue!**

1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Check if your domain (`janiechiro.com`) is listed
3. If not listed: Click "Add Domain" and add it
4. If listed but not verified:
   - Click on the domain
   - You'll see DNS records you need to add
   - Add these DNS records to your domain registrar:
     - SPF record
     - DKIM record (multiple TXT records)
     - DMARC record (optional but recommended)

5. After adding DNS records, wait 5-10 minutes
6. Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

**Your domain MUST show status "Verified" for emails to work!**

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration

1. In the WaitlistDashboard, click "Diagnostic Email System"
2. Check the console for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Le domaine "janiechiro.com" est v√©rifi√© et pr√™t
   ```
3. Click "Test Email Configuration"
4. Enter your email address
5. You should receive the email at YOUR email, not `delivered@resend.dev`

## Understanding the Console Warnings

The browser warnings about `fetch.worker.96435430.js` are unrelated to your email issue. These are from the development environment and don't affect functionality.

**Focus on these logs instead:**
```
üîç Domain janiechiro.com status: verified  ‚Üê This should say "verified"
‚úÖ Email sent successfully! Resend ID: abc123...
üìß Domaine v√©rifi√©: true  ‚Üê This should be "true"
```

---

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

### Check Current Status
1. Click "Diagnostic Email System" in dashboard
2. Look for this in console:
   ```
   Configuration Domaine: ‚úÖ Le domaine "janiechiro.com" est v√©rifi√© et pr√™t
   ```

### Test Email Delivery
1. Click "Test Email Configuration"
2. Enter: `maxime@giguere-influence.com`
3. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Your actual inbox (if domain verified)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `delivered@resend.dev` (if domain NOT verified)

---

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/diagnose-email-system/index.ts` - Domain verification checks
- ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/test-email/index.ts` - Pre-flight domain validation
- ‚úÖ `src/components/dashboard/WaitlistDashboard.tsx` - Enhanced UI feedback

All Edge Functions have been redeployed automatically.

## Next Steps

**If emails still go to delivered@resend.dev after following these steps:**

1. **Verify domain in Resend** - This is 95% likely to be your issue
   - Domain must show "Verified" status
   - All DNS records must be properly configured
   - May take 5-10 minutes after adding DNS records

2. **Check Supabase secrets** - Make sure they're exactly:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
   RESEND_DOMAIN=janiechiro.com  (NO https://, NO www)
   ```

3. **Run diagnostic again** - It will now tell you exactly what's wrong:
   - If RESEND_API_KEY missing: Critical error
   - If domain not verified: Critical error with specific guidance
   - If everything OK: All green checkmarks

---

## Support

If you continue to have issues after verifying your domain:

1. Check the Resend dashboard for domain verification status
2. Ensure DNS records are properly propagated (can take up to 24 hours)
3. Review the diagnostic output in console for specific errors
4. Verify you're using the correct API key from Resend

The diagnostic function will now give you precise information about what's wrong instead of generic errors.
